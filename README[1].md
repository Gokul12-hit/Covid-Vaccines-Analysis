Covid-19 Vaccines Analysis Project 

This code is designed to analyze Covid-19 vaccine data and visualize key insights. The code uses Python and the following libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. To run the code successfully, follow the instructions below.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, you need to ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3 (The code was developed using Python 3.x)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

```
## Project Structure
The project contains a single Python script (covid_vaccine_analysis.py) for data analysis and visualization. The dataset, covid_vaccine_data.csv, is expected to be in the same directory as the script.
## Deployment
To deploy this project run:
Clone this repository to your local machine:


```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
 cd covid-19-vaccines-analysis

```
Place your Covid-19 vaccine dataset in the project directory, and make sure it is named covid_vaccine_data.csv. The dataset should have the required columns for the analysis.

Run the Python script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations:
```bash
 python covid_vaccine_analysis.py


```

## Data Description
The dataset should have the following columns:

 `Date:`Date of the data entry

`Vaccinations:` Number of vaccinations administered

`Region:` Geographic region or location

`VaccinationRate:` Vaccination rate as a percentage

`Manufacturer:` Vaccine manufacturer name

`Efficacy:` Vaccine efficacy as a percentage


## Project Workflow
The code performs the following steps:

1.Loads the dataset.

2.Describes the dataset to provide basic statistics.

3.Checks for missing values in the dataset.

4.Computes the correlation matrix.

5.Visualizes vaccination trends over time, vaccination rates by region, and vaccine efficacy by manufacturer.
## Input and Output
* Input: Ensure that your dataset matches the expected format described in the "Dataset Description" section.

* Output: The code generates visualizations, and you can view them directly in the script's output. You can modify the script to save the figures if needed.
## Acknowledgements

This code uses the following libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. We acknowledge and thank the developers and communities of these libraries for their contributions.
